Peddler's Shop,"1907 Deptford Center Rd, Deptford Township",NJ,"A peddler, in British English pedlar, also known as a canvasser, chapman, cheapjack, hawker, higler, huckster, monger, or solicitor, is a traveling vendor of goods. In England, the term was mostly used for travellers hawking goods in the countryside to small towns and villages; they might also be called tinkers or gypsies. In London more specific terms were used, such as costermonger.

Peddlers have a long and colourful history. From antiquity, peddlers filled the gaps in the formal market economy by providing consumers with the convenience of door-to-door service. They operated alongside town markets and fairs where they often purchased surplus stocks which were subsequently resold to consumers. Peddlers were able to distribute goods to the more geographically isolated communities such as those who lived in mountainous regions of Europe. They also called on consumers, who for whatever reason, found it difficult to attend town markets. Thus, peddlers played an important role in linking these consumers and regions to wider trade routes. Some peddlers worked as agents or travelling salesmen for larger manufacturers, thus were the precursor to the modern travelling salesman.

Images of peddlers feature in literature and art from as early as the 12th-century. Such images weree imagery depicts peddlers in a pejorative manner, while others portray idealised, Romantic visions of peddlers at work.",No,off-road bicycle racing.,No

There are world class mountaineering and climbing routes on the peak that are only for the very established mountaineer.
